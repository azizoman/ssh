Password management
Companies are waking up to the inherent risks of password-based authentication; brute-force attacks and educated guesses are both serious risks to weak passwords.
 Many organizations use biometric (fingerprint or retinal scan-based) or two-factor authentication to mitigate these risks. 

Even web services such as Gmail and Dropbox offer two-factor authentication in which the user provides a password as well as a second value, such as the digits on 
an electronic token. If two-factor authentication is not available, using strong passwords is imperative for account security because all that stands between the attacker 
and sensitive data may come down to a simple string. 
Strong passwords are long, use characters from multiple complexity classes, and are not based on a dictionary word.

Password attack
Tools designed for automating online password attacks or guessing passwords until the server responds with a successful login. These tools use a technique called brute forcing. 
Tools that use brute forcing try every possible username and password combination, and given enough time, they will find valid credentials.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparing wordlists
If you don’t know the name of the user account you want to crack, or you just want to crack as many accounts as possible, you can provide a username list for the password-guessing tool 
to iterate through.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Lists
When creating a user list, first try to determine the client’s username scheme. For instance, if we’re trying to break into employee email accounts, figure out the pattern 
the email addresses follow. Are they firstname.lastname, just a first name, or something else?
# You can look for good username candidates on lists of common first or last names.
Create a file userlist.txt and enter the username of all hostmachine
root@kali:~# cat userlist.txt
georgia
john
mom
james
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cewl tool
#a tool like the ceWL custom wordlist generator will search a company website for words to add to your wordlist

root@kali:~# cewl -w bulbwords.txt -d 1 -m 5 www.bulbsecurity.com 

# The command ceWL --help lists ceWL’s usage instructions. Use the -d (depth) option u to specify how many links ceWL should follow on the target website.
#specify a minimum word length to match with the -m option v. Once you’ve made your choices, output ceWL’s results to a file with the -w option w. For example, 
to search www.bulbsecurity.com to depth 1 with minimum word length of 5 characters and output the words found to the file bulbwords.txt, you would use the command shown at x.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crunch
# Another method for creating wordlists is producing a list of every possible combination of a given set of characters, or a list of every combination of characters for a specified 
number of characters. The tool Crunch in Kali will generate these character sets for you. 

root@kali:~# crunch 7 7 AB 

# Crunch will now generate the following number of lines: 128 AAAAAAA, list of all the possible seven-character combinations of just the characters A and B with 7 character length

Guessing Usernames and Passwords with Hydra
# Hydra is an online password-guessing tool that can be used to test usernames and passwords for running services.

root@kali:~# hydra -L userlist.txt -P passwordfile.txt 192.168.20.10 pop3
Hydra to guess usernames and passwords by running through our username and password files to search for valid POP3 credentials on our Windows XP target

# This command uses the –L flag to specify the username file, the -P for the password list file, and specifies the protocol pop3
#Specific password for particular username then use this command
root@kali:~# hydra -l georgia -P passwordfile.txt 192.168.20.10 pop3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Offline Password Attacks
Another way to crack passwords (without being discovered) is to get a copy of the password hashes and attempt to reverse them back to plaintext passwords. 
This is easier said than done because hashes are designed to be the product of a one-way hash function: Given an input, you can calculate the output using the hash function.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John the Ripper
# One of the more popular tools for cracking passwords is John the Ripper. The default mode for John the Ripper is brute forcing. Because the set of possible plaintext passwords 
in LM hash is so limited, brute forcing is a viable method for cracking any LM hash in a reasonable amount of time, even with our Kali virtual machine, which has limited CPU power 
and memory.
# For example, if we save the Windows XP hashes we gathered earlier in this chapter to a file called xphashes.txt, then feed them to John the Ripper like this, we find that 
John the Ripper can run through the entire set of possible passwords and come up with the correct answer
root@kali: john xphashes.txt
