The default username and password for the router is admin: admin. The default credentials vary from device to device, but it’s common on penetration tests to 
find routing equipment that still uses the default credentials

root@kali:~# iwconfig

Scan for Access Points
we can scan for nearby access points. The command iwlist wlan0 scan will scan for nearby access points using the wlan0 interface

root@kali:~# iwlist wlan0 scan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Monitor mode
Monitor mode allows us to see additional wireless traffic on top of the traffic intended for our wireless card. We’ll use the Airmon-ng script, part of the 
Aircrack-ng wireless assessment suite, to put the Alfa card into monitor mode. First, make sure that no running processes will interfere with monitor mode by entering airmon-ng check

root@kali:~# airmon-ng check

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Killing running process
Airmon found two running processes that could interfere. Depending on your wireless card and its drivers, you may or may not run into any trouble if you don’t kill off these programs.

root@kali:~# airmon-ng check kill
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
airmon-ng start wlan0
Enter airmon-ng start wlan0 to switch the wireless interface into monitor mode
root@kali:~# airmon-ng start wlan0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Capturing Packets
With our interface in monitor mode, let’s see what data we can gather using Airodump-ng from the Aircrack-ng suite. Airodump-ng is used to capture and save wireless packets

root@kali:~# airodump-ng mon0 --channel 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open Wireless 
Open wireless networks are a real disaster from a security perspective because anyone within antenna range of the access point can connect to that network.

the wireless packets traveling through an open network are not encrypted, and anyone listening can see any data in plaintext

FTP traffic on an open wireless network is completely unencrypted, including login information, and we don’t even need to use ARP or DNS cache poisoning to capture the packets. 
Any wireless card in monitor mode will be able to see the unencrypted traffic. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEP – Security weakness
An attacker to recover a key or alter legitimate packets. In fact, every WEP key is recoverable by an attacker armed with enough cipher texts encrypted with the same shared key

We can use the Aircrack-ng suite to recover the shared key from a wireless network secured with WE

root@kali:~# airodump-ng -w book mon0 --channel 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wireless cracking
There are multiple ways to crack WEP keys, including the fake authentication attack, fragmentation attack, and PTW attack.
root@kali:~# airodump-ng -w book mon0 --channel 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Injecting packets
When using fake authentication, we tell the access point we’re ready to prove we know the WEP key

root@kali:~# aireplay-ng -1 0 -e linksys -a 00:23:69:F5:B4:2B -h 00:C0:CA:1B:69:AA mon0

-1 tells Aireplay-ng to fake authentication. 
• 0 is the retransmission time. 
• -e is the SSID; in my case linksys. 
• -a is the MAC address of the access point we want to authenticate with.
 • -h is the MAC address of our card (which should be on a sticker on the device). 
• mon0 is the interface to use for the fake authentication.
