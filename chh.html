Connecting into a network through a rogue modem attached to a
computer behind a firewall

Exploiting weaknesses in network transport mechanisms, such as TCP/IP and NetBIOS
 
Flooding a network with too many requests, creating a denial of service (DoS) for legitimate requests

Installing a network analyzer on a network and capturing every packet that travels across it, revealing confidential information in clear text

Piggybacking onto a network through an insecure 802.11b wireless configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploiting specific protocol implementations
 Attacking built-in authentication systems
 Breaking file-system security
 Cracking passwords and encryption mechanisms
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) applications are frequently attacked because most firewalls and other security mechanisms are configured to allow full access to these
programs from the Internet.

Malicious software (malware) includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses,and spyware. Malware clogs networks and takes down systems.

Spam (junk e-mail) is wreaking havoc on system availability and storage space. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Legal Issues of ethical hacking
The legal risks of ethical hacking include lawsuits due to disclosure of personal or confidential information
The professional issues of ethical hacking include possible ineffective performance on the job.
The ethical hacker makes sure that the client’s system or network is properly evaluated for security issues and vulnerabilities. 
The code of ethics must focus on the protection of the client’s system or network, as well as the effectiveness of the ethical hacker in doing his job.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code of Ethics:
Ensure that you know and understand the nature and characteristics of the client organization’s business, system and network
determine the sensitivity or confidentiality of the information involved
maintain transparency with the client. Communicate all relevant information you found while ethically hacking the client’s system or network. 
Stay within the target areas of the system or network specified in the work agreement.
never disclose client information to other parties. Ensure the protection of the client.
Private information must be kept private, and confidential information must be kept confidential.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ethical Hacking Process
#You need someone to back you up and signoff on your plan.
#Get written approval on this sponsorship as soon as possible
#to ensure that none of your time or effort is wasted
#If you’re testing for customer, have a signed contract in place
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Formulating your plan ( Well defined Scope)
#Specific systems to be tested
#Risks that are involved
#When the tests are performed and your overall timeline
#How the tests are performed
#How much knowledge of the systems you have before you start testing
#What is done when a major vulnerability is discovered
#The specific deliverables
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Points to consider while doing ethical hacking process
#When selecting systems to test, start with the most critical or vulnerable systems.
#Handle social-engineering and denial-of-service attacks carefully.
#Determining when the tests are performed
#Don’t stop with one security hole
#One of the goal is to perform testing process without being detected.
#Requires basic understanding of the system. This will help you protect the tested systems
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Familiarize the tools
#Read the readme or online help files for your tools.
#Study the user’s guide for your commercial tools.
#Consider formal classroom training from the security-tool vendor or another third-party training provider, if available

Look for these characteristics in tools:
#Adequate documentation.
#Detailed reports on the discovered vulnerabilities, including how they may be exploited and fixed.
#Updates and support when needed.
#High-level reports that can be presented to managers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Executing the plan
Things to do:
Time and patience are important. Be careful when you’re performing your ethical hacking tests.
Just make sure you keep everything as quiet and private as possible.
encrypt these e-mails and files

Broad view and Narrow your focus:
Search the Internet for your organization’s name, your computer and network system names, and your IP addresses.
Narrow your scope, targeting the specific systems you’re testing.
Further narrow your focus with a more critical eye. Perform actual scans and other detailed tests on your systems.
Perform the attacks, if that’s what you choose to do.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aspects of real world security	
The computer systems aren’t properly patched, hardened.
Most network and security administrators simply can’t keep up with the deluge of new vulnerabilities. 
Information System grow more complex every day. Reason why overburdened administrators find it difficult to know what’s happening across the wire and on the hard drives of their systems.

Attack:
Defenses are weaker at night.  With less physical security and no administrators.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Techniques Used by Hackers
Borrowed or stolen dial-up accounts from friends or previous employees
Public computers at libraries, schools, or kiosks at the local malls
Internet proxy servers 
Anonymous or disposable e-mail accounts from free e-mail services
Unsecured computers

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Determining What Systems to Hack
What are your most critical systems? Which systems, if hacked, would
cause the most trouble or the greatest losses?
Which systems appear to be most vulnerable to attack?
Which systems are not documented, are rarely administered, or are the
ones you know the least about?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List of System and Applications for testing
Routers
Firewalls
Network infrastructure as a whole
Wireless access points and bridges
Web, application, and database servers
E-mail and file/print servers
Workstations, laptops, and tablet PCs
Mobile devices (such as PDAs and cell phones) that store confidential
information
Client and server operating systems
Client and server applications, such as e-mail or other in-house systems
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What specific systems you should test depends on several factors
Where the computer or application resides on the network
Which operating system and application(s) it runs
The amount or type of critical information stored on it
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing Standard
Timing:
You know they say that it’s “all in the timing.” This is especially true when
performing ethical hacking tests. Make sure that the tests you’re performing
minimize disruption to business processes, information systems, and people.
Everyone in the project should agree on a detailed timeline before you begin.
Notify the ISP and Application server providers(ASP) 

Specific tests:
may want to perform specific tests, such as cracking passwords or war-dialing
into a network Or you might be performing a social-engineering test or assessing the Windows operating systems on the network.
document and make known at a high level what you’re doing. This can help eliminate any potential miscommunication

Blind versus knowledge assessments:
The type of assessment you carry out depends on your specific needs.
The best approach is to plan on unlimited attacks, wherein any test is possible

Location:
The tests you’re performing dictate where you must run them from. Your goal
is to hack your systems from locations where malicious hackers can access
the systems.

Silly assumptions:
Computers, networks, and people are available when you’re testing.
You have all the proper hacking tools. 
The hacking tools you’re using won’t crash your systems
Your hacking tools actually work
You know all the risks of your test
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Penetration testing
involves simulating real attacks to assess the risk associated with potential security breaches.
SQL injection vulnerabilities
social-engineering attacks
weak passwords
security of the wireless networks

On a penetration test, we find these issues before an attacker does, and we recommend how to fix them and avoid future vulnerabilities
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Stages of the Penetration Test
Pre-engagement phase
Information gathering phase
Thread Modelling phase
Vulnerability Analysis phase
Exploitation  phase 
Post exploitation phase
Reporting phase
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scope
What are the IP addresses or hosts in Scope
What sort of actions will the client allow you to perform.
Does the client understand that even a simple port scan could bring down  a server or router?
