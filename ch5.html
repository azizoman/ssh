Netcraft is a website analyzing server, with the help of this website we find basic and important information on the website like:-

the information that web servers and web-hosting companies gather and make publicly available can tell you a lot about a website
which operating system it uses
in which web server it runs
how much a website is secure
the scripted language that website used
in which technology a website works
hosting providers
ISPs
encrypted transactions
uptime information and much more.

Whois lookup	
All domain registrars keep records of the domains they host. These records contain information about the owner, including contact information
root@kali:~# whois bulbsecurity.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DNS
We can also use Domain Name System (DNS) servers to learn more about a domain. DNS servers translate the human-readable URL www.bulbsecurity.com into an IP address.
root@Kali:~# nslookup www.bulbsecurity.com
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Searching e-mail address
#way to find usernames is by looking for email addresses on the Internet.
#use a Python tool called theHarvester to quickly scour thousands of search engine results for possible email addresses.

theHarvester -d bulbsecurity.com -l 500 -b all

-d domain, -l limit, -b source

Port scanning
# mapping the network range and querying systems for listening ports. We can do this manually by connecting to ports with a tool such as telnet or Netcat and recording the results. 
# Let’s use Netcat to connect to the Windows XP machine on port 25, the default port for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
# Netcat can be used to make arbitrary connections to network services. As a result, it can be used to make HTTP requests to a web-server much like a web-browser would. Let’s go ahead and grab the index page from google.com. Enter the nc command followed by the host and the port you want to connect to.
root@kali:~# nc 192.168.0.110 25
root@kali:~#nc google.com 80
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Port Scanning
# Firewalls with intrusion-detection and prevention systems have made great strides in detecting and blocking scan traffic.
# so you might run an Nmap scan and receive no results at all. Though you could be hired to perform an external pentest against a network range with no live hosts,
 it’s more likely that you’re being blocked by a firewall. 

# On the other hand, your Nmap results might instead say that every host is alive, and will be listening on every port if your scan is detected.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tcp Syn scan
# In a SYN scan, Nmap sends the SYN and waits for the SYN-ACK if the port is open but never sends the ACK to complete the connection. 
# If the SYN packet receives no SYN-ACK response, the port is not available; either it’s closed or the connection is being filtered. This way, Nmap finds out 
if a port is open without ever fully connecting to the target machine. 

#The syntax for a SYN scan is the -sS flag.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UDP Scan

In a UDP scan (-sU), Nmap sends a UDP packet to a port. Depending on the port, the packet sent is protocol specific. 
If it receives a response, the port is considered open. If the port is closed, Nmap will receive an ICMP Port Unreachable message. 

If Nmap receives no response whatsoever, then either the port is open and the program listening does not respond to Nmap’s query, or the traffic is being filtered

Nessus vulnerability scanner
#Nessus is one of the most widely used commercial vulnerability scanners
#Nessus is available as a paid professional version that pentesters and inhouse security teams can use to scan networks for vulnerabilities. 
#You can use the free, noncommercial version called Nessus Home

root@kali:~# service nessusd start
Now open a web browser, and access Nessus by directing the Iceweasel
browser to https://kali:8834.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install nessus
1. Open Applications->Web Browser and enter
http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-home/ in the address bar. Complete the Register for an Activation Code information and click Register.
(Use a real email address—you’ll need the activation code later.)
2. Once you reach the Downloads page, choose the latest version of Nessus for the Linux Debian 32-bit platform (Nessus-5.2.5-debian6_i386.deb and download it to 
your root directory (the default download location).
3. Open a Linux terminal (click the terminal icon at the top of the Kali
screen) to open a root prompt.
4. Enter ls to see a list of the files in your root directory. You should see the Nessus file that you just downloaded.

5. Enter dpkg -i followed by the name of the file you downloaded (you can
type the first letter of the filename and press tab to use tab completion) and press enter to begin the install process. Installation may take a while as Nessus 
processes various plugins. Progress is shown by a line of hash symbols (#).
